# Armageddon Watch
A simple (very rough around the edges) API mashup created in a couple of hours at the [Brighton Java](https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Java/) "Fun With APIs" meetup.

This mashup uses the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API along with the NASA Near Earth Object API.  For more on these API and others see https://api.nasa.gov/
